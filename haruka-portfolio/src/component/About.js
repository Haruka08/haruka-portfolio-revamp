                Hi! Welcome to my portfolio, my name is Haruka.
                I'm from Japan but spend over 20 years in the UK studying and working in automotive industry.
                Since having a taste of programming through work using Microsoft Excel and VBA etc. I found myself enjoying the process and feeling exhilarated when the program worked as I intended!
                This inspired me to enroll myself onto a coding bootcamp to learn the trade in detail!
                I'm new to web development but I love problem solving and I will tackle any bugs with enthusiasm!
            </p>
